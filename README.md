# This folder is related to the experimental, phase field, informatics, and neural network-based Design of Corrosion-Resistant Super Duplex Stainless Steel (UNS S32750 Grade 2507) fabricated via Laser Powder Bed Fusion. 

This repo hosts CPP curves and code for samples: AS, SR400/1h, SR450/1h, SR500/1h, SR550/1h, SA1100/15min.

## Repo layout:
- `data/` — raw/processed CPP data (e.g., `cpp.csv`)
- `figures/` — publication-ready plots (PNG/SVG)
- `notebooks/` — `cpp.ipynb`
- `scripts/` — plotting scripts (if any)
